<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Electrical Stimulation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rechargeable SCS</li><li>Non-Rechargeable SCS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal electrical stimulation (SCS) devices market is divided into two main types: rechargeable SCS and non-rechargeable SCS. Rechargeable SCS devices allow patients to charge the battery, extending device longevity and reducing the need for replacement surgeries. They offer greater flexibility in usage and often feature advanced programming capabilities. In contrast, non-rechargeable SCS devices come with a fixed battery that cannot be recharged, leading to simpler usage but requiring eventual surgical replacement. Both types are used to manage chronic pain effectively.</p></p>
